        <p>Hi there! Welcome to my portfolio page. My name is Alex Wambugu, an aspiring web developer and a student at <em>Moringa School</em>. I seek to weave for the web and I am inspired by the Golden Orb, one of the greatest web weavers of nature.</p>

      <p class="who">So who exactly is Alex Wambugu?</p>
      <p>Well, I am just your average guy from down the street except not so average. I've been around a few places and seen a couple of people in my brief period here on earth but at the same time, I have learnt so much. Essentially, I've come to believe we live because we are. Therefore, my goal is to create awesome web apps that will help people do just that. Be who they are. So that's me. <span class="rhetorical">Who you?</span></p>
