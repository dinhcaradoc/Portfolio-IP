      <p class="who">So who exactly is Alex Wambugu?</p>
      <p>Well, I am just your average guy from down the street except not so average. In my brief stint thus far on Planet Earth, I've been around a few places and seen a couple of people. Through my experience, I have learnt the immense power of networks and connections. Eseentially, we live because we are. Therefore, my goal is to create awesome web apps that will help people do just that. Be who they are. So that's me. <span class="rhetorical">Who you?</span></p>
